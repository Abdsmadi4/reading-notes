# React: Component Lifecycle Events
 The **methods** that you are able to use on component classes are called lifecycle events , These methods can be called during the lifecycle of a component.
 
### phases of the component lifecycle :
-Mounting
-Updating
-Unmounting 
 
 ## Mounting
 is when React "renders" the component for the first time and actually builds the initial DOM from those instructions.
 
 ## Updating
 this can happen when state or props changes
 
 ## Unmounting
 it is removing nodes from the DOM and it is the final phase of the lifecycle .
 
 ## constructor()
  The constructor is a method used to initialize an object's state in a class, and the constructor in a React component is called before the component is mounted.
