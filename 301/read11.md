## SQL vs NoSQL

 | SQL | NoSQL |
 | ----- | ----- |
 | Relational Databases (RDBMS) | non-relational or distributed database. |
 | table based databases | document based, key-value pairs |
 | have predefined schema | dynamic schema for unstructured data |
 | vertically scalable | horizontally scalable |
 | good fit for the complex query intensive environment | not good fit for complex queries |


## SQL database examples:
- MySql
- Oracle
- Sqlite
- Postgres 
- MS-SQL


## NoSQL database examples:
- MongoDB
- BigTable
- Redis
- RavenDb
- Cassandra

- Neo4j
- CouchDb
